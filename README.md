**An Overview of Suicide Rates from 1985-2016**

Suicide Rates have always been an issue around the world. In that particular sense, we want to continue to raise awareness towards this issue and allow more and more people to understand and examine the increase of suicide rates over the past few years - specifically from 1985 - 2016.

# Project Description 

  The data that we will be examining is Suicide rates around
the world based upon various catagories such as GDP, age-range,
and gender across different countries. This dataset
was acquired from Kaggle which pulls data from the **United**
**Nations**, The **World Bank**, **World Health Organization**, and a
notebook that contains records of suicides across the world.
This is important for people to be able to analyze patterns
and recognize specific danger areas that need help.
Identifying troubling areas to send councillors and experts
can help decrease suicide occurrences and possibly help
communities grow.

# Expected Audience 

  The target audience is **adults and teenagers** since the end goal is to spread awareness of mental health. 
Mental health advocates and possibly doctors with the background in mental health would be able to
target these zones and decrease the number of suicides;
Teenagers should be more aware of the mental
health of their peers as well, so targeting this broad range
would help increase the awareness in a school setting and a 
public setting. Looking at different demographics across the
world may give people ideas on how to treat mental health 
universally.

# What Should People Learn From our Presentation?

  The audience should learn at least four key things about 
our dataset:

1. Examine the country's data concerning the number of suicides

2. Examine and observe the suicide numbers in each given age group for that country

3.  Identify trends in a line graph that shows the total suicide rates for selected years

4. Draw conclusions based on gdp comparisons, age comparisons, gender comparisons, and percent increase/decrease in the number of suicides.

Most importantly, we want the user to understand that suicide rates is in general affected by many, many factors. We show that GDP does have an effect in suicide rates, however it is not only the reason that defines suicide rates in the world today. We want to show awareness but also allow the user to at the same time answer/observe the following questions: 

1. What is the most vulnerable age group in a specific year in a specific country?

2. Is there an increase or decrease of total suicide numbers across the years?

3. What is the increase and decrease percentage of suicide rates between a range of years? 

4. Does a change in GDP show a relationship with suicide rates?

5. Of a particular year, which age group contributed to the highest number of suicides?
